GristMill
==
GristMill is a Java application based on [Emphysic's Myriad Toolkit](https://gitlab.com/ccoughlin/datareader), designed to find Regions Of Interest (ROI) in sensor data in a distributed processing system.

GristMill designed to run unattended on a server, waiting for [data](http://myrdocs.azurewebsites.net/api/com/emphysic/myriad/network/messages/DatasetMessage.html).  When data are received, GristMill automatically looks for ROI by subsampling and scanning across the data and sending the results to a machine learning model trained to recognize a particular type of ROI.  It's more or less the same procedure shown in this single-process [Myriad sample](https://emphysic.com/myriad/sample-code/roi-detection-pipeline/), but uses []Myriad's concurrency tools](https://emphysic.com/myriad/faq/#concurrency) to build a system that can run across multiple CPUs, in a cluster, etc.
 
Building
==
You'll need to [build the Myriad toolkit](http://myrdocs.azurewebsites.net/install/).

Once that's taken care of, `mvn package` should be all that's required.

Running
==
After you've built the JAR it runs just like every other JAR, but you'll need to provide it with the full path and filename of a configuration file.  The `gristmill.conf` file in the root project folder is a good place to start, just edit as you see fit.

Next, send it some data!  You can use any Myriad-based application to send it data.  If you don't configure a [ReporterPool](http://myrdocs.azurewebsites.net/api/com/emphysic/myriad/network/ReporterActorPool.html), GristMill will default to logging the ROI it finds.

About Myriad
==
Myriad is a library written in Java that provides tools for image / signal processing, machine learning, and fault-tolerant distributed computing. Its primary purpose is to assist with the development of large-scale Region Of Interest (ROI) detection applications by providing the parts required to train a model to detect ROI in large datasets.  

Example applications include face detection, pedestrian tracking, and anomalous signal identification.  Myriadâ€™s [original application for NASA](http://sbir.nasa.gov/SBIR/abstracts/16/sbir/phase1/SBIR-16-1-H13.01-8360.html) was to detect indications of structural damage in nondestructive evaluation data.
